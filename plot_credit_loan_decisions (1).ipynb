Using the\n","[harms taxonomy in the Fairlearn User Guide](https://fairlearn.org/main/user_guide/fairness_in_machine_learning.html#types-of-harms), we expect this system to produce *harms of allocation*. In\n","addition, we also anticipate the long-term impact on an individual\\'s\n","credit score if an individual is unable to repay a loan they receive or\n","if they are rejected for a loan application. A *harm of allocation*\n","occurs when an AI system extends or withholds resources, opportunities,\n","information. In this scenario, the AI system is extending or withholding\n","financial assets from individuals. A review of historical incidents\n","shows these types of automated lending decision systems may discriminate\n","unfairly based on sex.\n","\n","**Negative impact of credit score**\n","\n","A secondary harm that is somewhat unique to credit lending decisions is\n","the long-term impact on an individual\\'s credit score. In the United\n","States, a [FICO credit\n","score](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit_score.asp) is a\n","number between 300 and 850 that represents a customer\\'s\n","*creditworthiness*. An applicant\\'s *credit score* is used by many\n","financial institutions for lending decisions. An applicant\\'s *credit\n","score* usually increases after a successful repayment of a loan and\n","decreases if the applicant fails to repay the loan.\n","\n","When applying for a credit loan, there are three major outcomes:\n","\n","1.  The individual receives the credit loan and pays back the loan. In\n","    this scenario, we expect the individual\\'s credit score to increase\n","    as a result of the successful repayment of the loan.\n","2.  The individual receives the credit loan but defaults on the loan. In\n","    this scenario, the individual\\'s credit score will drop drastically\n","    due to the failure to repay the loan. In the modeling process, this\n","    outcome is tied to a **false negative** (the model predicts the\n","    individual will repay the loan, but the individual is unsuccessful\n","    in doing so).\n","3.  In certain countries, such as the United States, an individual\n","    receives a small drop (up to five points) to their credit score\n","    after a lender performs a *hard inquiry* on the applicant\\'s credit\n","    history. If the applicant applies for a loan but does not receive\n","    it, the small decrease in their credit score will impact their\n","    ability to successfully apply for a future loan. In the modeling\n","    process, this outcome is tied to the **selection rate** (the\n","    proportion of positive predictions outputted by the model).\n","\n","**Prevention of wealth accumulation**\n","\n","One other type of harm we anticipate in this scenario is the long-term\n","effects of *denying loans to applicants who would have successfully paid\n","back the loan*. By receiving a loan, an applicant is able to purchase a\n","home, start a business, or pursue some other economic activity that they\n","are not able to do otherwise. These outcomes are tied to **false\n","positive error** rates in which the model predicts an applicant will\n","default on the loan, but the individual would have successfully paid the\n","loan back. In the United States, the practice of redlining [[4](https://www.context.news/socioeconomic-inclusion/redlining-in-america-how-housing-discrimination-endures.)], denying\n","mortgage loans and other financial services to predominantly Black or\n","other minority communites, has resulted in a vast racial wealth gap\n","between white and Black Americans.
